              Dear Shareholders,
              <br />
              <br />
              <span className='font-bold'>HIL is now BirlaNu. </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              This transformation reflects our collective aspiration
              to be a leading global provider of innovative,
              sustainable Home & Building solutions. It marks a
              strategic evolution grounded in our commitment
              to innovation, sustainability and customer first
              approach. It extends across our people, processes and
              digital initiatives, ensuring we stay ahead in a rapidly
              evolving industry.
              <br />
              <br />
              The updated brand architecture brings together,
              under BirlaNu, the full breadth of our offerings across
              Pipes, Construction Chemicals, Putty, Roofs, Walls
              and Floors. This alignment strengthens how our
              customers and partners understand who we are and
              what we stand for.
              <br />
              <br />
              This rebranding is at the heart of a strong, strategic
              push towards fast-paced, value-building growth both
              in India and at Parador. Over the next 3 years, we aim
              to double ourselves as a company and move closer to
              our ambition of becoming a billion dollar company.

            This growth will come through:
            <br />

            <ul className="space-y-2">

                <span className="absolute left-0 top-2 w-2 h-2 bg-[#afb1a7] rounded-full" />
                Scaling up high growth categories like
                Pipes, Construction Chemicals, Designer
                Boards & Blocks
              </li>

                <span className="absolute left-0 top-2 w-2 h-2 bg-[#afb1a7] rounded-full" />
                Expanding our global footprint – not just through
                Parador’s deeper entry into the US, China,
                Middle-east and India, but also by unlocking
                export markets for our Indian portfolio

                <span className="absolute left-0 top-2 w-2 h-2 bg-[#afb1a7] rounded-full" />
                Extending our play in Home & Interiors beyond
                our core strength in Building Products. The India
                launch of Parador is an important first step
              </li>
              <li className="relative pl-6 text-[#4d4d4f]">
                <span className="absolute left-0 top-2 w-2 h-2 bg-[#afb1a7] rounded-full" />
                Strengthening our presence across Retail,
                Commercial and Government channels
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            FY25 was a challenging year, marked by an uncertain
            macroeconomic environment and weak demand
            across our markets. A 2-5% price decline across most
            categories added significant margin pressure. In
            pipes, the impact was sharper, with a 10%+ decline
            driven by a meltdown in PVC resin prices.
            <br />
            <br />
            In this scenario, we chose to focus on:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul className="space-y-2">
              <li className="relative pl-6 text-[#4d4d4f]">
                <span className="absolute left-0 top-2 w-2 h-2 bg-[#afb1a7] rounded-full" />
                Gaining market share in our growth segments
                (Pipes, Parador, CC) – outperforming industry
                volume growth across all three
              </li>
              <li className="relative pl-6 text-[#4d4d4f]">
                <span className="absolute left-0 top-2 w-2 h-2 bg-[#afb1a7] rounded-full" />
                Agile cost management to minimize margin
                impact – through focused “Missions” targeting
                contribution margin improvement and
                manpower costs.
              </li>
              <li className="relative pl-6 text-[#4d4d4f]">
                <span className="absolute left-0 top-2 w-2 h-2 bg-[#afb1a7] rounded-full" />
                Judicious investments for long term growth
                – across capacity enhancement, product
                innovation, branding, technology and
                sustainability initiatives
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            In FY25, at a consolidated level BirlaNu reported
            revenue of INR 3,615 Cr, 7% higher vs LY and
            EBITDA of INR 88 Cr. Growth was driven by strong
            performance in Pipes and CC segments and at
            Parador. Pipes is now the second largest segment
            in our India portfolio. Significantly, the non-Roofs
            portfolio is now over 70% - a strategic shift we had set
            out to achieve.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our Pipes segment delivered record breaking
            volume growth establishing us as the fastest
            growing player in the segment. Revenue grew 57%
            YoY with volumes up 76%. This is despite PVC price
            volatility touching multi year lows. Key achievements
            included successful integration of Crestia and
            growth of the Topline brand in retail. The institutional
            & government segment, especially Jal Jeevan
            Mission, remained muted, but we stay optimistic
            about a revival in FY26. With strong brand recall,
            comprehensive and differentiated product portfolio
            and expanding channel & regional presence, we are
            well positioned to drive scale and market share –
            creating significant long term value in this segment.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Construction Chemicals segment delivered 23%
            revenue growth in FY25. With strong management
            focus, dedicated sales teams and a pipeline of new,
            differentiated products, we are well placed to grow
            share in this fast growing segment.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our Roofs business sustained its leading market
            share and superior price and profitability positioning
            closing the year with revenue of INR 1134 cr. This is
            despite intense competition and price erosion in the
            market. During the year, we launched several new
            products, especially, ultracool Roofs.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our Walls segment remained largely flat in FY 25, on
            both revenue and volume. Operating profitability
            held steady at 10% despite nearly 3% price erosion
            reflecting disciplined margin management. We
            continue to aggressively drive value enhancement
            initiatives and expect margin improvement in FY26.
            <br />
            <br />
            Parador continues it’s strong momentum in FY 25
            with revenue of INR 1,227 Cr, up 7% YoY and volume
            growth of 9%, significantly outperforming both
            industry and competitors. Despite recessionary
            conditions and weak consumer sentiment, reflected
            in muted construction and flooring demand, we
            pivoted effectively. Leveraging agile pricing strategy,
            sales team restructuring and expansion into new
            markets including India, we doubled down on
            growth through commercial segments, product
            innovation and improved execution. Strong cost
            discipline and optimized capital deployment ensured
            lean operations.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our people and partners define who we are—and
            building a future-ready BirlaNu starts with investing
            in the right leadership and frontline teams. Being
            ranked #12 in India and #41 in Asia by Great Place
            to Work is a proud recognition of our culture and
            people practices.
            <br />
            <br />
            As we step into FY26, we remain watchful of the
            global macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape.
            Yet, we carry forward the momentum of recent
            quarters, backed by a strong brand portfolio,
            robust distribution, and our focus on product and
            digital innovation
            <br />
            <br />
            The road ahead is clear. With integrity, collaboration,
            and excellence at the core, we are set to redefine
            industry benchmarks and drive meaningful impact.
            As the world evolves, BirlaNu brand remains
            committed to shaping spaces where life unfolds and
            inspiring beautiful, lasting design with our customers
            at the heart of everything we do.

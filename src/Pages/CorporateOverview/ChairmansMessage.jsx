              Dear Shareholders,
              <br />
              <br />
              I’m pleased to share that we’re at the
              beginning of a new chapter at the Group
              level: the CK Birla Group is now the CKA Birla
              Group.
              <br />
              <br />
              This change reflects more than a name, it
              marks the Group’s continued evolution. From
              our manufacturing roots, we’ve grown into
              a services led enterprise with technology at
              the core. The new identity better represents
              our diversified portfolio, broader customer
              base and global presence. It also reaffirms
              our belief in people: our teams and leaders,
              as central to how we build, grow and
              create lasting value.
              <br />
              <br />
              As we move ahead under the CKA Birla
              identity, we remain deeply committed to
              building long term trust with our customers
              and empowering people across businesses.
              This evolution is equally reflected in how HIL
              has reimagined its purpose and identity. HIL
              is now BirlaNu.
              <br />
              <br />
              BirlaNu isn’t just a name, it reflects our
              renewed purpose and promise to be the
              partner you trust in building the future.
              BirlaNu is inspired by the people we serve
              and driven by a passion for continuous
              growth. Rooted in connection, creativity and
              sustainability, we empower homeowners, builders and designers

            to bring their vision
            to life, crafting innovative buildings and
            structures that stand the test of time. We’re
            deeply committed to building a global
            brand, one that’s backed by a stronger
            manufacturing footprint and focused growth
            in high potential categories.
            <br />
            <br />
            The past year has been one of meaningful
            transition. As we embraced our new name
            and purpose, we also navigated a complex
            macroeconomic environment, reflected in the
            year’s measured financial performance. We
            delivered a consolidated revenue of
            ₹3,615 crore, a 7% increase over the previous
            year and an EBITDA of ₹88 crore.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the Pipes segment, we delivered industry
            leading growth of 57%, supported by the
            successful integration of Crestia Polytech
            (Topline), which is already unlocking product
            and market synergies. Construction Chemicals
            continued its strong momentum, growing 23%
            year on year. Our Charminar brand reinforced
            its leadership in Roofs, maintaining both share
            and price positioning. The Walls category
            remained flat amidst subdued demand
            and pricing pressures. Across segments, we
            responded with disciplined cost focus to
            protect margins while staying aligned to long
            term growth priorities.
            <br />
            <br />
            Despite recessionary pressures and muted
            consumer sentiment in key European
            markets, Parador delivered strong
            performance, growing revenue by 7% and
            volumes by 9%. This was driven by agile
            pricing, a restructured sales engine and
            expansion into several growth markets. Our
            sharper focus on commercial segments,
            product innovation and execution drove this
            momentum, while disciplined cost and capital
            management ensured operational efficiency.
            <br />
            <br />
            During the year, our brands received
            significant recognition, Charminar and
            BirlaNu Aerocon were awarded Superbrands
            and named Brand of the Year by Realty+.
            Equally important was the recognition of our
            sustainability efforts, which remain central
            to our long term strategy. Certifications from
            GRIHA, IGBC and GreenPro reaffirm our commitment to responsible raw material
            sourcing and innovation across energy use,
            waste management and product design.
            <br />
            <br />
            We’ve always believed that growth must
            come with responsibility, towards our
            customers, communities and our people. In
            FY25, we impacted over 30,000 beneficiaries
            from underserved communities through
            focused social programmes, while continuing
            to invest in our people and culture. We were
            proud to be ranked 12th among India’s Best
            Companies to Work For and 41st in Asia’s Best
            Workplaces 2024, recognitions that reflect
            our commitment to building a modern,
            diverse and future focused workplace where
            every team member can contribute with
            pride and purpose.
            <br />
            <br />
            Building a strong, future ready organization
            also means embracing the technologies
            that are reshaping our world. In the building
            solutions industry, AI and digital innovation
            are unlocking new ways to go to market,
            serve customers and streamline operations.
            That’s why we’re investing in AI led tools,
            not just to sharpen our supply chain but to
            elevate customer experience and deliver more
            tailored responsive solutions.
            <br />
            <br />
            We remain deeply committed to creating
            long term value for our customers, partners
            and shareholders. On behalf of the Board
            of Directors, I thank you for your continued
            support and trust. As we step into this
            next chapter under the BirlaNu brand, we
            carry forward what has always defined us,
            delivering value, building with integrity and
            growing with purpose.
            <br />

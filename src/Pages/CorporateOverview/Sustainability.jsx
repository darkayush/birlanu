                  We are committed to sustainable growth by protecting the environment, ensuring employee
                  well-being and upholding the highest safety standards while strictly complying with all
                  occupational health, safety and environmental regulations. We are committed to reducing our

                  By driving circularity, repurposing industrial waste and pioneering innovations like OBS for
                  UPVC pipes, we turn challenges into opportunities. Our zero-discharge plants, expanded
                  solar integration and use of renewable fuels, which now power half our operations, reflect our
                  dedication to a greener future.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We have implemented energy-efficient technologies across manufacturing facilities and
                  increased our renewable energy contribution to 46.5%. Emissions have been reduced by nearly
                  2%, accompanied by water savings through optimised rainwater harvesting and recycling
                  systems.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Ethically sourced, waste conscious and powered by clean energy, we are shaping a world where
                  responsibility and innovation go hand in hand. We are not just building – we are redefining
                  what is possible in a sustainable future.

                  At BirlaNu, our approach to sustainable development goes beyond responsibility — it reflects
                  our commitment to building resilient, self-reliant communities. Our social impact efforts
                  are anchored around the pillars of health and wellness, education and skill building and
                  community development.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We collaborate with respected partners such as the Live Love Laugh Foundation (LLL), Child
                  Survival India (CSI), and Sambhav Foundation to amplify the reach and impact of our
                  community efforts.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Through these meaningful partnerships, we are challenging stigmas around mental
                  health and enhancing access to healthcare in rural areas, enabling children to remain
                  in school, and fostering self-reliance and livelihood skill adoption amongst underserved
                  communities. Each initiative is a step toward creating inclusive growth and building a
                  healthier, more equitable future for all.

          <p className="text-[#4d4d4f] mb-5 md:text-lg">
            Governance at BirlaNu is structured to ensure that decisions are made with accountability,
            fairness, and clarity. The approach is built on clear responsibilities and adherence to
            ethical practices across all levels of the organisation. The focus remains on balancing
            business priorities with stakeholder interests, while ensuring compliance with applicable
            regulations and standards. Transparency, integrity, and consistency are the principles that
            guide how we operate and how decisions are evaluated.
            <br />
            <br />
            To support this, a set of defined policies and committee-led oversight mechanisms are in
            place to manage areas such as risk, ethics, sustainability, and stakeholder relations. These
            frameworks are reviewed regularly to stay aligned with regulatory developments and
            evolving expectations.
            <br />
            <br />
            Details of our governance policies and committee structures are available on our website at
